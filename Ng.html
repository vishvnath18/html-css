It has launched an initiative under the name of "My City – Smart City" with a belief that creative ideas can come up from any quarter of the citizens. NMC is also very optimistic that the ideas thus received can be of immense use to the city planners. In order to facilitate this, a communication platform needs to be formed, wherein citizens can come up and offer their valuable suggestions. To enhance the reach of this communication platform all possible means like – A dedicated website, Social media channels, drop boxes for suggestions in physical forms and a dedicated telephone line would be utilized. The suggestions / ideas can be offered in any form, language, area etc. The openness and non limitation on any parameters of the invitation is designed so as to get maximum participation from every section of the society.

There are some basic rules which however need to be understood to present your ideas on the right forum/category. The ideas/ suggestions should fit in the category framework as below: </h3>
